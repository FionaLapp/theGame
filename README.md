# theGame

Mom got us [this card game](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(Kartenspiel)) for Christmas and Clara mentioned that she'd tried to code a strategy for it but gave up, so the only logical response was to spend Christmas break obsessing about it.
## Contents
- game.py a file containing game logic, as well as some basic hard-coded strategies
- game_test.py a few unit tests to be run after any changes in game.py. To run, use "pytest game_test.py" in the directory where the file is located (needs more tests)
- game_logging.py change values in this file to modify logging behaviour (needs to be cleaned up /commented slightly)
- plotting.py some initial plots to get an understanding of the impact of parameters (needs to be cleaned up)
- profiling.py running this will help identify where calculations can save time (needs to be cleaned up)
- reinforcement_learning.py (currently not working yet)
