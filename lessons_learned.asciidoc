### Lessons learned
Since I'm just doing this to get some programming experience (and definitely not
due to an unhealthy level of curiosity concerning the essentially irrelevant strategies
of a game I've played three times so far), here are some of the lessons that I want future-me
to remember:

- CLEAN CODE IS EVERYTHING!!!!! (I already knew this, of course, but I need to start acting like I know it, too)
- no, but really, clean code is everything.
- cProfile is a lifesaver when it comes to slow code
- logging can slow you down if you're doing large calculations. But also, it's important, so it's worth figuring out a way to do it with as little overhead as possible (and having an option to disable it).
- it really helps to have someone look over your code (thanks, Clara)
- going in with a (rough) plan probably saved me a lot of time
- clean. code. is. everything.
- writing unit tests might be annoying (and you can probably get away with not writing a test for literally everything, if you're in a hurry), but having tests for core functions does save time in the long run.

... to be continued (hopefully)
