# A TO-DO-list (or something like that)

## nice-to-haves:
- clean up logging
- plot current strategy function for other inputs
- plot current strategy function with error bars
- not looping over lists when calculating basic_metric. Somehow use numpy instead?
- add number of already-played cards to state
- add and analyse jump count
- clean up plotting file

## a bit further down the road
- add GUI
- add reinforcement learning
- learn about multiprocessing to make the whole thing faster?

## stuff I'll probably never implement
- remembering the cards that have already been played for calculating the metric
- playing more than two cards at once if you have one that has a distance of less than (number_of_cards/number_of_piles) from a top-card
- thinking ahead by one step when playing a card (i.e. playing 2 cards at once?)
- looking at everyone else's cards instead of just own cards (but then what?)

## questions worth thinking about
- is the succes-percentage vs. number_of_cards plot a cumulative Gaussian distribution? If so, is there a mathematical explanation? (Thanks for asking, Clara, but I have no idea)
- what would happen if there was a counter-player who tried to give everyone the worst possible cards instead of drawing them at random?
- Can I program a strategy that more-or-less implements what humans would do, and if so, how much better or worse would it perform compared to reinforcement learning?
- Can this be modelled with markov chains? If so, would the amount of calculations be feasible?
